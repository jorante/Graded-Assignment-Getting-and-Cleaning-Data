#Code Book for tidy dataset assignment from Coursera

The present tidy data is the result of an R script applied to the UCI Human Activity Recongnition Dataset available in the Machine Learning Repository at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

According to the source, this data is the result of "Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors."

The R script merges the 'training' and 'test' sets into one data set, and then extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviations for each measuremsnt.

Summary of variables calculated:

1- timeBodyAccMagnitudeMean
2- timeBodyAccMagnitudeStdDev
3- timeGravityAccMagnitudeMean
4- timeGravityAccMagnitudeStdDev
5- timeBodyAccJerkMagnitudeMean
6- timeBodyAccJerkMagnitudeStdDev
7- timeBodyGyroMagnitudeMean
8- timeBodyGyroMagnitudeStdDev
9- timeBodyGyroJerkMagnitudeMean
10- timeBodyGyroJerkMagnitudeStdDev
11- freqBodyAccMagnitudeMean
12- freqBodyAccMagnitudeStdDev
13- freqBodyAccJerkMagnitudeMean
14- freqBodyAccJerkMagnitudeStdDev
15- freqBodyGyroMagnitudeMean
16- freqBodyGyroMagnitudeStdDev
17- freqBodyGyroJerkMagnitudeMean
18- freqBodyGyroJerkMagnitudeStdDev
